Final Project

Description: Modern art museum consisting of paintings, pottery, sculptures, and flowers.

Things to take note of:
1) To limit the polygon count of my program, I created flowers using textures and shaders. Instead of drawing each petal and center using 
multiple objects, I used one object and applied a texture of a flower with a black background to it. I then created a shader program that 
discards all the black pixels. Thus the result is a realistic looking flower! This is the same with the pottery peices and dome room star ceiling.
2) Collision detection. I implemented collision detection to all the paramters of the building and within.
3) Instead of bulding the bigger things using large sized objects, such as the walls of the meuseum, I used a bunch of smaller quads so that
the lighting could be more granular and realistic on the walls and floor rather than the whole thing lighting up
4) Used interesting objects/shapes to make the ceiling pieces and the sculptures, as well as the columns. 

How to compile & run:
- in the directory run "make" then run "finalproject"

How to do basics:
- l          Toggles lighting
- p          Toggles first-person/perspective projection
- a/A        Decrease/increase ambient light
- m          Toggles light movement
- +/-        Change field of view of perspective/ zoom in and out
- PgDn/PgUp  Change field of view of perspective/ zoom in and out
- x          Toggle axes (default: not shown)
- arrows     Change view angle or walk
- 0          Reset view angle
- ESC        Exit


How to change view:
- up arrow key      to move the view up
- down arrow key    to move the view down 
- left arrow key    to move the view left
- right arrow key   to move the view right:
- PgDn/PgUp         to zoom in and out: 
- 0 key             to reset the view and dim

How to walk in first person view:
- up arrow key      to move forward: 
- down arrow key    to move backward: 
- left arrow key    to turn left
- right arrow key   to turn right

How to change projection:
- p         to change the mode: 
			- first mode is perspective
			- second mode is first person

How to exit:
- esc       to exit
