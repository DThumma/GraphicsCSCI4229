Assignment 5: Lighting

NOTE: The structure that is the table bottom, in code is suppose to be smooth but renders more geometerical, which is why the normals 
point the way they do. This object is created in the tablebottom() function. I spoke with Professor Schreuder on 10/12/17 in office hours about 
it and we agreed the lighting looks good for the object. Thanks!

- F1         Toggle smooth/flat shading
- F2         Toggle local viewer mode
- F3         Toggle light distance (1/5)
- F8         Change ball increment
- F9         Invert bottom normal
- m          Toggles light movement
- []         Lower/rise light
- p          Toggles ortogonal/perspective projection
- +/-        Change field of view of perspective
- </>        Manually move light along path
- x          Toggle axes
- arrows     Change view angle
- PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
- 0          Reset view angle
- ESC        Exit


How to change view:
- up arrow key      to move the view up
- down arrow key    to move the view down 
- left arrow key    to move the view left
- right arrow key   to move the view right:
- PgDn and PgUp     to aoom in and out: 
- 0 key             to reset the view and dim

How to walk in first person view:
- up arrow key      to move forward: 
- down arrow key    to move backward: 
- left arrow key    to turn left
- right arrow key   to turn right

How to change projection:
- m         to change the mode: 
			- first mode is orthoginal
			- second mode is perspective (default)
			- third mode is first person

How to change what you see:
- a         to show/unshow axis

How to exit:
